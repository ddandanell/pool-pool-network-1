## Plan for Link Integration (White-Zone Context)
Target sites: **https://aquapurebali.com/** and **https://balipoolservice.com/**.

### Step 1: Site Evaluation and Setup
- Audit host pages with Google Search Console/Ahrefs to find high-authority, high-traffic URLs aligned to terms like “Bali pool services” or “water purification Bali.”
- Confirm thematic compatibility before placement and back up the site.

### Step 2: Link Integration Methods
- Use contextual, visible placements that aid navigation; avoid concealment.
- Choose anchors such as “expert Bali pool cleaning” (balipoolservice.com) and “pure water solutions Bali” (aquapurebali.com) for relevance without appearing contrived.

### Step 3: Strategic Placement for Enhanced SEO Value
- Homepage: place links in hero/intro sections to leverage core authority.
- High-traffic content pages: embed early in body copy (first 200–300 words) and within externally linked pages.
- Navigation/sidebars: persistent menus or side panels for site-wide recurrence.
- Footer: 1–2 universal links for steady exposure without over-optimization.
- Category/hub pages: cluster around “Bali Services” style hubs to reinforce E-A-T.
- Emerging pages: strengthen weaker pages by linking from stronger ones.

### Step 4: Implementation and Oversight
- Roll out 15–25 links across 4–8 pages; monitor via Google Analytics and Search Console.
- Vary anchors/positions over time to mimic natural growth; track terms like “Bali pool service” (e.g., in SEMrush).

### Step 5: Cautionary Measures
- Prioritize user-facing value and context; avoid aggressive repetition.
- Review regularly for visibility swings and adjust placements or anchors accordingly.
